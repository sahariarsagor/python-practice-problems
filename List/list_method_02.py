# sort(): Sorts the list in ascending order (in-place, meaning it modifies the list).

# myList = [2, 4, 6, 8];
# myList.sort();
# print(myList);

# reverse(): Reverses the order of the list (in-place).

# myList = [2, 8, 5, 6];
# myList.reverse();
# print(myList);

# extend(iterable): Extends the list by appending all elements from another iterable (like another list).

# myList = [1, 2, 3];
# myList.extend([4, 5, 6]);
# print(myList);

# count(item): Returns the number of times an item appears in the list.

# myList = [2, 4, 6, 2, 4, 5, 2];
# returnValue = myList.count(2);
# print(myList);
# print(returnValue);

#clear(): Removes all items from the list.

# myList = [2, 4, 6];
# myList.clear();
# print(myList);
